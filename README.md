information about the Script
  - MusicSync script is easy to use for developers to customize how GameObjects will react to music based on their liking by enabling the booleans.
  - MusicSync  script allows you to dynamically adjust the scale, rotation, and position of specific game objects in response to the music's rhythm.
  - Scaling can occur along the X, Y, and Z axes, and the degree of scaling is controlled using ScaleX, ScaleY, ScaleZ, and scaleMod.
  - Rotation can happen around the X, Y, and Z axes, with angles determined by the music's beat data and specified by RotateX, RotateY, and RotateZ.
